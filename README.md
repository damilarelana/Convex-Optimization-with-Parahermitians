# Economic Parameterization of Parahermitian Matrix Functions

## This Matlab algorithm implements a parameterisation of Parahermitian Matrix Functions to obtain a state-space solution for μ-analysis. It is a mathematical optimisation problem & solution algorithm which does not use a frequency-dependent curve fitting approach. The algorithm/implementation gives a frequency-independent μ upper bound value and way to obtain μ without using Matlab's prioprietaray mu command. The theoretical and mathematical basis are detailed in the my [published academic paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016769111100140X)
